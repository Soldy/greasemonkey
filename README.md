This is a Grease Monkey fork under the terms of the MIT license.
The primary reason for this fork is that the original development team no longer has the time to maintain the code.
 I decided to fork it to update the code, fix bugs, and add some additional features. 
To be clear, I never considered the original Grease Monkey code to be of high quality; however, I have fond memories of it, which motivated me to take on this.


 **Updates Made:**

 - Fixed the Continuous Integration (CI) testing; this is a priority for me, but it's only a temporary fix. Karma needs to be replaced with an alternative.

 - Addressed an asynchronous race condition issue; this is another short-term fix that does the job but isnâ€™t the optimal solution.

 - Updated CodeMirror 5 to the latest version.

 - Added support for multiple CodeMirror 5 themes.

 - Implemented CodeMirror 5 keymap support.

 - Prepared for support for multiple code editors.

 - Developed an advanced setup page.


 **Future Plans:**

 - Implement advanced keymap support.

 - Integrate CodeMirror 6.

 - Integrate Monaco Editor.

 - Integrate Ace 9.

 - Develop built-in documentation.

 - Provide built-in assistance support.

 - Support for third-party editors.

 - Fix the meta tag processing issues.


 That's all, Folks. Live long and prosper! (In Peace)
